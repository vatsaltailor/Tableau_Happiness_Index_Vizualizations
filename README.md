# Tableau_Happiness_Index_Vizualizations

This presentation represents a team effort, where we used beautiful Tableau vizualizations to see:

1. What factors affect the Happiness Index and how do they affect Happiness Index?
2. How did the factors change pre-COVID vs post-COVID?
3. Vizualizing how Happiness Index changed pre-COVID and post-COVID
